// Mini-Challenge #4 "Greater Than or Less Than"
// This is a program that asks a user to enter two numbers, then compares each number 
// as greater than, less than, or equal to the other

// peer review: Andrea Burr - i really like it i was able to type yes in any way and it still did great i even did the same numbers and it handedle it correct, i think it works really great i thinki i like how if you enter something invalid its a cute message of "whoops" i thought that was super cute but i woulndt change anything about it
